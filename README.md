# Solutions to *Satisfiability Modulo Theories: A Beginner’s Tutorial* #

[*Satisfiability Modulo Theories: A Beginner’s Tutorial*](https://cvc5.github.io/tutorials/beginners/index.html) is an excellent practical walkthrough of interacting with SMT solvers. Part of this tutorial is a set of exercises, of which this repository contains my solutions to in the form of [valid SMT-LIB code](https://smt-lib.org/papers/smt-lib-reference-v2.6-r2024-09-20.pdf).

The full source material is available [here](https://github.com/cvc5/tutorials/tree/main/beginners). The code in this repository is largely an annotated version of the code there.
